/** Provides classes to work with system processes in a type safe way.
  *
  * Refer to the <a href="/docs">user guide</a> for more information.
  *
  * A process to be executed is represented by the [[Process]] trait. Once it
  * has finished running the results are in [[ProcessResult]]. We call a group
  * of processes attached together a process group, represented by
  * [[ProcessGroup]], its result is described by [[ProcessGroupResult]].
  *
  * Redirection of input, output and error is enabled by the
  * [[RedirectableInput]], [[RedirectableOutput]] and [[RedirectableError]]
  * trait for single processes, and the [[RedirectableErrors]] trait for process
  * groups.
  *
  * Processes and process groups are executed by a [[ProcessRunner]], the
  * default implementation is called [[JVMProcessRunner]].
